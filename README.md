# Breat_cancer_survival_prediction
Breast cancer is a form of cancer that originates in the breast.
Breast cancer is more common in women, but males can develop it as well. 
In women, it is the second biggest cause of death. Because data is widely used in healthcare today, 
machine learning may be used to predict whether or not a patient will survive breast cancer.

### I used SVM and Naive Bayes Machine Learning algorithms to predict patient survival.
